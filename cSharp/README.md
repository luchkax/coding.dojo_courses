In this course, you will learn how to create web applications using the C# programming language and the .NET Core environment, specifically ASP.NET Core. There are seven chapters in this course.

The first chapter is an introduction to the primary concepts of the course.

The second chapter covers the foundations of the C# language, primarily through console applications. In addition to the different syntax, you will get accustomed to the slightly different workflow that occurs from C# being a compiled language.

The third chapter covers a .NET micro framework that is similar to Sinatra (for Ruby) and Flask (for Python). In fact, this framework's name, NancyFx, is an homage to the Sinatra framework since Nancy Sinatra is the daughter of Frank Sinatra. The reason we teach NancyFx before ASP.NET Core is because Nancy is smaller and more direct. There are fewer hidden parts and less work is done automatically for you, so you will learn what really happens with HTTP requests and responses in .NET.

In the fourth chapter, we get into the real meat of the course, the ASP.NET Core MVC framework. This will draw upon the MVC paradigm that you have learned from the previous course(s).

The fifth chapter involves using the built-in ORM for .NET, the Entity Framework. Although we will have connected to the database already, we will use EF to do more sophisticated queries with more elegant source code.

The sixth chapter covers subjects like security and scalability, that you can integrate into your ASP.NET Core projects.

In the seventh and final chapter, we will cover additional material that should prove important and interesting to you, such as Windows Identity Foundation and Microsoft Cognitive Services.
